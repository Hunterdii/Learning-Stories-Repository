## 👋 Introduction

Hi! I’m **Het Patel**, a curious learner and a coding enthusiast.  
I started my journey experimenting with small Python scripts, breaking things, and slowly understanding how computers “think.”

This story is about my steps into programming, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I’m still learning.

---

## 🌱 Early Days

- I began with simple Python programs — printing my name, adding two numbers.
- My first big excitement came from building a **portfolio generator** with the help of AI tools.
- I also worked on an **AI Resume Analyzer** and deployed it successfully on [Render](https://ai-resume-analyzer-and-enhancement-system.onrender.com/).

> “I learned that deployment isn’t the end — it’s the beginning of feedback and improvements.”

## 🚀 Key Projects

| Year | Project | Highlights |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2023 | **Auto-Portfolio Generator** | Learned HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages for hosting |
| 2024 | **AI Resume Analyzer** | Integrated multiple ML models, deployed to the cloud |
| 2025 | **Hackathon Contributions** | Collaborated with peers, learned teamwork and version-control |

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Iterate fast** — don’t wait for perfection to launch.
2. **Ask for help** — communities (and AI tools) accelerate learning.
3. **Read error messages** — most problems already have clues in the traceback.

## 🔮 Future Goals

- Master full-stack development.
- Contribute to more open-source repositories.
- Build a tool that helps beginners visualize algorithms.
